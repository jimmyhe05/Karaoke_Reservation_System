## ðŸ’¡Inspiration

The Karaoke Reservation System was inspired by my experience working at "Nam's Noodle," a family-owned restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin. My cousin owns the restaurant, which also features karaoke rooms as part of its unique dining experience.

Managing reservations manually for these rooms was often challenging, especially during peak hours when multiple parties requested overlapping time slots. This inspired me to create a practical and efficient tool to streamline the process of handling room reservations.
